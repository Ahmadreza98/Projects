# Decorator
---
A decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function — without changing its code. Think of it like:

> "Wrapping" a function to add extra features to it.
### Basic Structure
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function runs")
        func()
        print("After the function runs")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```
### Output:
```terminal
Before the function runs
Hello!
After the function runs
```
The `@my_decorator` syntax is just a shortcut for:
```python
say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)
```
